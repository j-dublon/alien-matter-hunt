# Alien Matter Hunt

A simple, one page React app that serves data from [NASA's meteorite landings API](https://data.nasa.gov/Space-Science/Meteorite-Landings/gh4g-9sfh).

Users can pick a region from a drop down menu and see a selection of meteorite landings in that region. Clicking on the markers displays the name of the site and the year of the strike. Site names are also displayed in a list - when list items are clicked, the meteorite popup is triggered.
